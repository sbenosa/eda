## EDA
In statistics, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a process of getting a grip of the data, analyze data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. Primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. It serve many purposes, but some that stand out are preparing your data for modeling, trying to find some trends and answering initial questions. By having a high level understanding of our data, we will be able to further our analysis and get more comfortable towards the process of building the model.
